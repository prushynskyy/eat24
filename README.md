This is my outcome of taking Gordod Zhu Angular Course! First Angular.JS app

YOu should check it out! 

### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Testacular](http://vojtajina.github.com/testacular/) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Testacular (`sudo npm install -g testacular`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Testacular server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/testacular.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run do one of:
  * open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser
  * run the tests from console with [Testacular](vojtajina.github.com/testacular) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` or `script/e2e-test.bat`

### Continuous Integration

CloudBees have provided a CI/deployment setup:

<a href="https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/?CB_clickstart=https://raw.github.com/CloudBees-community/angular-js-clickstart/master/clickstart.json"><img src="https://d3ko533tu1ozfq.cloudfront.net/clickstart/deployInstantly.png"/></a>

If you run this, you will get a cloned version of this repo to start working on in a private git repo, 
along with a CI service (in Jenkins) hosted that will run unit and end to end tests in both Firefox and Chrome.

### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just
fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.
